Salary Prediction with Linear Regression:

This repository contains code for predicting salaries based on levels of experience using linear regression.

Introduction:

The code demonstrates the process of predicting salaries based on levels of experience using linear regression. The provided dataset contains information about levels of experience and corresponding salaries.

The dataset used for this project is provided in the file Position_Salaries (1).csv. It contains the following columns:

Level: Levels of experience.
Salary: Corresponding salaries.
Setup:
Make sure you have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Instructions:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure that the dataset Position_Salaries (1).csv is placed in the same directory as the code file.
Run the code in a Python environment. It will load the dataset, visualize the data, split the data into training and testing sets, train a linear regression model on the training set, and plot the results.
Code Overview
Data Loading: The code starts by loading the dataset using pandas.
Data Exploration: The code provides summary statistics and visualizes the data using seaborn and matplotlib.
Data Splitting: The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
Model Training: The code trains a linear regression model using the training set.
Model Evaluation: The code evaluates the model using the training set and plots the results.
Results
The code plots the training data and the regression line, which allows you to visualize how well the linear regression model fits the data.

Conclusion
The provided code serves as an example of using linear regression for salary prediction based on levels of experience. Further optimization and model selection can be performed to improve the model's accuracy.
